# Style guide
All the content on DefElement aims to conform to this style guide. This keeps it clear and consistent.

We use standard British spelling in the content on DefElement.

In general, we follow the [<em>Chalkdust</em> style guide](https://chalkdustmagazine.com/style-guide/)
(which follows the [<em>Guardian</em> style guide](https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-a)
with some additional guidance, mostly related to the style of equations). The remainder of this
page lists style guidance not covered in the <em>Chalkdust</em> style guide.
